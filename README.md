**Exploring Urban Scaling Laws in Western Australia**

This project investigates urban scaling laws in Western Australia using various machine learning techniques and statistical analyses. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the application of clustering algorithms and self-organizing maps (SOMs) to uncover hidden patterns and relationships between demographic, socioeconomic, and health indicators. The project provides valuable insights into urban development and regional disparities, facilitating sustainable development and addressing societal challenges in Western Australia.
